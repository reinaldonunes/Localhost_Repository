# Localhost_Repository
Custom localhost for listing web project folders. It can be used on any PHP server, such as WAMP, XAMPP, EasyPhp, etc. 
<br /><br />
List your projects using this customized repository: more elegance, more practice!
<br /><br />
## HOW TO USE
The Index file and assets folder should be directly inside your local server's htdocs or htmldocs folder (XAMPP, WAMP, etc).
<br />
When accessing http://localhost/ in the browser, the file will be conjured and list your folders more elegantly.
